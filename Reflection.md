Starting with Django was exciting but also confusing at times. I struggled at first with the project setup since I placed my templates in the wrong folder, and Django couldnâ€™t load them properly. I also forgot to add my app to INSTALLED_APPS, which meant my views did not appear until I fixed that mistake. Another issue was with URL routing because I kept messing up the path syntax, and those errors took me a while to figure out. At first, these problems felt frustrating, but they pushed me to carefully recheck my code and learn how Django actually handles configuration.

On the good side, Django installed smoothly once my environment was set up, and running the development server for the first time felt really rewarding. Using Git also made it easier to save my work and backtrack whenever I made mistakes. Overall, these challenges taught me to be more cautious during setup and gave me confidence in debugging problems.
