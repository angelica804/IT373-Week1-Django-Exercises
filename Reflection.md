Starting with Django was exciting but also confusing at times. I
struggled at first with the project setup since I placed my templates in
the wrong folder, and Django couldn't load them. I also forgot to add my
app to INSTALLED_APPS, so my views didn't appear until I fixed it.
Another issue was with URL routing i kept messing up the path syntax,
which caused errors that took me a while to figure out.

On the good side, Django installed fine once my environment was set up,
and running the server felt rewarding. Git also made it easier to save
my work, even when I made mistakes. These challenges taught me to be
more careful with setup and gave me confidence in debugging.
